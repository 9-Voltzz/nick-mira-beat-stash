These are the official Zaytoven instruments (gathered from his cook ups/vlogs). To open these you need to:

*Download Kontakt 5 then

FOR PIANO: Download the "Native Instruments Classic Piano Collection" (Library For Kontakt) and install
*NO LONGER SOLD BY NATIVE INSTRUMENTS, FIND IT ELSE WHERE *COUGH COUGH* ;) 
Then open the provided preset in this folder.

FOR ORGAN: Download the "Native Instruments Vintage Organs" (Library For Kontakt) and install
Then open the provided preset in this folder. 
it's important to use the provided preset file by me because the preset in the folder has 
Zaytoven's and Cassius Jay's official organ tuning settings
